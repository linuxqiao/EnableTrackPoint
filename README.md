# EnableTrackPoint

* Update by Nov-7-2017
From fedora-25, the system support "IBM TrackPoint". So we don't need change anything.

X1 Carbon - fedora22
 * add bashrc.conf.x1-fedora22 to ~/.bashrc
 * re-login

X230 - CentOS7 / fedora23
 * move thinkpad.conf.x230-centos7 to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/thinkpad.conf
 * restart
